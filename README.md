# Buy Becca's Veggies Recipes using Solana Pay

## App Overview

This app was designed to demonstrate the exchange of digital goods in a decentralized manner using Javascript, React, and Solana libraries. This app eliminates needs for middleman services that collect fees and data from daily users.

Users are able to connect their Web3 wallet to the site to purchase and download recipes on the Solana blockchain. 

If the owner of the Solana store (in this case Becca's Veggies Wallet) is connected to the site, they have the ability to add new products to the product display mapped out. These products are directly uploaded to Web 3 storage and refrenced by CID.
